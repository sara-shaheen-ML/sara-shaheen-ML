 ## 🌟 Dr. Sara Shaheen 

# AI Researcher • Data Scientist • Educator

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a Computer Science PhD (KAUST, 2017) with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision. I previously served as an Assistant Professor at Prince Sultan University (Saudi Arabia) and Sheridan College (Canada), where I taught Machine Learning, Data Structures, Algorithms, and AI.

After taking some time away for family and international relocation, I am now rebuilding my AI research portfolio and refreshing my technical skills.
